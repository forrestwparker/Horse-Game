# Horse Game

This is a simple implementation of a game inspired by an interview question that was given to candidates applying for a job with Facebook. The goal is to determine the three fastest horses (in order) from among a set of 25 horses. The restriction is that the only tool available to you is a racetrack with only five lanes. The additional challenge is to make the determination while conducting the fewest number of races possible.

There is a strategy which only requires seven races. Can you determine what the strategy is?


Additional note: This game was created using Python 3 on macOS Sierra. The tkinter layout used by the game leaves something to be desired on Windows.
